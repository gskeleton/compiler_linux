/* #pragma once is a pragma introduced in this pull request: https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler/pull/463
 * and added in gcompiler v3.10.7.
 * Its purpose is to act as an include guard using only a pragma.
 * In fact, this pragma works partly like an include guard triggered by the -Z flag,
   but with some slight modifications.
